- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Billy @bkb-Git

- I am new to the software development community and I am ready to get working on some projects to improve on my skills.

- I have dived into some languages and frameworks from React, NextJS, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, D3.js, Node.js and MongoDB. I am looking to add to those overtime as i garner more experience
  with what I have learnt already.

- I hope to delve into both front-end and back-end projects to build myselft into a full-stack developer.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email address: billykbett@gmail.com
