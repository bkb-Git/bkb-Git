  ### About Me
  
---
  




ðŸ‘‹   Hi, Iâ€™m Billy Kipkorir Bett. I'm a <span style="color:red">Software Engineer</span> from :kenya: Kenya.

   I have built a couple of applications specifically serveless ðŸ’» SPAs (Single Page Applications) which have been successfully deployed. Take a look at          them on my LinkedIn.

   I also have some back-end development experience building microservices for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application using Node.js,            Express.js and MongoDB.
   
   I am a massive âš½ Chelsea fan and love to unwind catching up on ðŸ“º tv shows.

   I believe Web3 and AI are the ðŸš€ future so I've been learning about and following these fields closely with a deep interest to get into them when the opportunity arises.
   
   
       
       

    ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email address: ðŸ“§ billykbett@gmail.com
