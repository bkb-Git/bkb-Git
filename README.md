- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Billy @bkb-Git

- I am new to the software development community and I am ready to get working on some projects and have fun coding.

- I am proficient in some languages and frameworks such as React, NextJS, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, D3.js, Node.js and MongoDB. I am looking to add to those overtime as I garner more experience as a developer.

- I hope to delve into both front-end and back-end projects to build myself into a full-stack developer.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email address: billykbett@gmail.com
