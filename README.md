- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Billy @bkb-Git

- I am new to the software development community and ready to get working on some projects to improve on my skills.

- I have dived into some languages and frameworks from HTML,CSS,Javascript,jQuery,React,Node.js and Moongoose. I am looking to add to those overtime as i garner experience
  with what I have learnt already.

- I hope to delve into both front-end and back-end projects to build myselft into a full-stack dev but "baby steps, baby steps" is what i tell myself. 

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my email address: billykbett@gmail.com
